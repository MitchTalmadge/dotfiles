## Folder Structure

### bin
Contains scripts for installing, updating, migrating, etc.
Pretty boring, honestly.

### lib
Uhh, other useful third party stuff I guess

### shells
Config files for each shell individually, all bourne shells, and all shells in general. Also contains an amend directory for making amendments to the originals so you can use a custom-config on certain servers.

### tools
For the tools, like tmux, vim, etc.

### usr/bin
It's on the PATH. For my own included-in-this-repo executables or whatever


## Shell Structure

More details in the shell folder.
