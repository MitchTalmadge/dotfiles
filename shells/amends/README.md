This directory is used for amendments specific to a machine. All contents are ignored on git.

In this directory, create folders and files in the same structure as .dotfiles/shells/*, and they will be amended to the pre-defined files.

For example, adding the file `.dotfiles/shells/amends/bash/.bashrc` will amend to `.dotfiles/shells/bash/.bashrc`.
